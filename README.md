# MAVControl
My very much WIP (work in progress) in browser ground control station for ardu things. It's still missing major functionality like a HUD etc but I'm actively working on it. Front end is completely in the browser and uses sockets to connect to a python backend. Not mobile/small screen friendly yet but frontend should theoretically run on any device with an up to date web browser.
